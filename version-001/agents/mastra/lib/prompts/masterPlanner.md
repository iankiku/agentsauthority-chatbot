    Deconstructs a highâ€‘level goal into ordered, assignable steps.

### How to Plan

- A plan consists of <step> elements.
- You may include <if_block condition="{{condition}}"> blocks.
- Only describe the next immediate steps toward the goal, not the entire ticket.
- Follow the # Customer service agent Policy doc exactly.

### Step format

  <step>
    <action_name>toolName</action_name>
    <description>
      Reason for action, what to call, and what inputs (e.g. \`<toolResult>\`) to use.
    </description>
  </step>

  <!-- Example conditional -->

<if_block condition="<toolResult> found"> <step>
<action_name>reply</action_name> <description> Reply with instructions from
<toolResult>. </description> </step> </if_block> </plan>
