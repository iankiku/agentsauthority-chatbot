## ✅ Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (Priority 1) - COMPLETED

### ✅ Fix OpenRouter credit limits - Reduce max_tokens in agent requests

- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **File:** `apps/agents/mastra/lib/llm/index.ts`
- **Changes:** Reduced `maxTokens` from 8000 to 4000 for both `defaultModel` and
  `fallbackModel`
- **Impact:** Resolves "This request requires more credits, or fewer max_tokens"
  errors

### ✅ Implement SSE endpoints - Add /api/agent-status/[jobId] for real-time progress

- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **File:** `apps/fragment/app/api/agent-status/[jobId]/route.ts`
- **Features:**
  - ✅ Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation
  - ✅ Real-time progress updates every 2 seconds
  - ✅ Job status tracking (pending, processing, completed, failed)
  - ✅ Proper cleanup on client disconnect
  - ✅ CORS headers for cross-origin requests

### ✅ Modify existing endpoints - Return job ID immediately, process asynchronously

- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **File:** `apps/fragment/app/api/brand-monitor/analyze/route.ts`
- **Changes:**
  - ✅ Returns job ID immediately instead of waiting for completion
  - ✅ Starts asynchronous processing with `processAnalysisAsync()`
  - ✅ Uses `jobStore` for status tracking
  - ✅ Provides status URL for client polling

### ✅ LLM JSON Generation Fixes

- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **File:** `apps/agents/mastra/lib/llmJSONCall.ts`
- **Changes:**
  - ✅ Uses `const { object } = await generateObject({ ... })` for both default
    and fallback models
  - ✅ Proper error handling with `NoObjectGeneratedError` detection
  - ✅ Clear error logging for both attempts
  - ✅ Meaningful error messages if both models fail

### ✅ Model Configuration Updates

- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **File:** `apps/agents/mastra/lib/llm/index.ts`
- **Changes:**
  - ✅ Switched default model from `qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b` to `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
    (more reliable for JSON)
  - ✅ Added `anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` as fallback model
  - ✅ Reduced max_tokens to 4000 to avoid credit limits
