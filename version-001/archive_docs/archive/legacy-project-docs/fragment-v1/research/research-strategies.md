CEO at Graphite

Overview
AI-powered search engines, such as ChatGPT, Bing’s new AI search, and Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE), have transformed how users discover information online. These models focus on answering questions directly, often referencing content without necessarily linking to it. To succeed in this AI-driven landscape, brands need to evolve their SEO strategies. In this unit, we’ll cover co-occurrence optimization, citation optimization, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). You’ll learn how to position your content for visibility in AI-generated answers, enhance discoverability, and track success across various platforms.

1
Understand the Foundations of AI Search Optimization





Search engines have always been about delivering relevant results to users, but AI-based models bring a new layer of complexity. Rather than just delivering a list of links for users to click through, AI-powered search engines aim to deliver answers directly. This shift presents two new optimization challenges:

Answer Optimization: How to get your product or content featured in the AI-generated answer itself.
Citation Optimization: How to ensure your content is cited as the source of the AI-generated answer.
This unit focuses on these two key challenges and introduces an additional layer of strategy with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).



2
Co-occurrence Optimization: The New SEO Strategy



In traditional SEO, optimizing for keywords was the key to ranking high. In AI-driven SEO, the goal shifts toward co-occurrence. Co-occurrence refers to the frequency with which your brand or product appears alongside relevant topics across the web. AI models "learn" associations between topics and products based on how often they are mentioned together in reliable sources.



Here’s how you can optimize for co-occurrence:

Step 1: Identify Target Topics

Before you can increase your co-occurrence, you need to know which topics you want your product to be associated with. These are often closely tied to the problems your product solves. For instance:

A project management tool might want to co-occur with terms like "best project management software," "team collaboration tools," and "Kanban boards."
A nutrition app like Noom would want to co-occur with terms such as "weight loss," "BMI calculator," and "diet tracking."
Step 2: Spread Your Content Across Different Platforms

AI models pull from a wide range of sources, including forums, articles, blogs, and UGC platforms like Reddit and Quora. The more places your product co-occurs with relevant topics, the higher the probability that it will appear in AI-generated answers. Ensure your brand is mentioned frequently across these platforms.

Here’s how you can do this:

Write guest blog posts on related topics.
Engage in discussions on forums like Reddit or Quora.
Leverage partnerships to have your brand mentioned on industry websites.
Step 3: Monitor and Adjust for Changes

Co-occurrence isn’t static. AI models are continuously trained on new data, which means you need to monitor where and how often your product is mentioned. Tools like BuzzSumo, Ahrefs, and SimilarWeb can help track co-occurrences and adjust your strategy accordingly.



3
Citation Optimization: How to Be the Source in AI Answers



Citation optimization is the next evolution of traditional backlinking. When AI models generate answers, they often reference specific sources as supporting evidence. These citations are becoming increasingly important in building trust and authority.



Step 1: Build Content that Deserves Citation

AI models cite authoritative, high-quality content. To increase your chances of being cited, your content must meet these standards:

Comprehensive: Your content should provide in-depth, detailed answers to common user questions.
Original: Ensure your content offers unique insights or perspectives not found elsewhere.
Up-to-Date: AI models pull from the most current sources, so regularly update your content.
Step 2: Choose the Right Citation Opportunities

To optimize for citations, focus on creating content that answers highly specific, valuable questions. For example, if you’re in the credit card space, aim to create a “Best Credit Cards for 2024” guide that thoroughly covers options, interest rates, and benefits. Look for citation opportunities by targeting question-based queries.

Step 3: Partner with Influential Sources

Many citation-worthy articles are created by reputable sources such as NerdWallet, Forbes, or U.S. News. Work with these high-authority platforms to get your brand mentioned in their articles, increasing your chances of being cited by AI engines.

Step 4: Analyze Citations

Use tools like Google Search Console and Ahrefs to identify when and where your content is being cited. Pay attention to ChatGPT’s and Perplexity’s use of your content as citations, and explore partnerships or paid sponsorships to increase your visibility.



4
Leveraging RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for Discoverability



Large language models like GPT-4 often pair with traditional search engines to pull in relevant content. This process, known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), is increasingly used to ensure that the AI model’s answers are accurate. Here’s how to optimize for RAG:



Step 1: Create Content That AI Models Want to Use

AI models retrieve content based on its relevance to the question asked. To optimize for RAG, your content needs to:

Answer specific, actionable questions (e.g., "What is the best project management software in 2024?").
Include structured data that is easy for search engines to interpret.
Be factually accurate and consistently updated.
Step 2: Use Structured Markup

Structured markup, such as schema.org metadata, helps AI engines interpret your content correctly. For example, adding FAQ schema to your articles makes it more likely that your content will be retrieved for question-based queries.

Step 3: Leverage Multi-Surface Optimization

Your content shouldn’t just be optimized for Google. AI models like ChatGPT, Bing AI, Anthropic, and others pull from a variety of sources, including YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. Ensure your SEO efforts extend across these platforms as well.



5
Tracking and Measuring Success: Share of Voice and AI Discoverability



AI search optimization requires new metrics to gauge success. Traditional keyword tracking becomes less relevant as AI-driven search results are less about rankings and more about share of voice and citations.



Step 1: Use Share of Voice (SOV) Analysis

Share of voice refers to how often your brand or content appears in AI-generated answers relative to competitors. Tools like SEMrush or Brandwatch can help measure your SOV across platforms like Google and Bing’s AI.

Step 2: Monitor Citation Frequency

Keep track of how often your content is cited by AI models. The more frequently your content is cited, the more trust it gains in AI answers. Use tools like Moz and Ahrefs to track citation rates.

Step 3: Set Benchmarks

Set benchmarks for how often your brand should appear in AI answers or be cited in relevant searches. Track progress over time and adjust your content strategies based on data insights.



6
Practice applying these skills - Optimize Your Content for AI Search and Discovery



In this exercise, you will apply the strategies learned in this class to optimize your content for AI-powered search engines. You’ll focus on increasing your content's visibility in AI-generated answers, optimizing for citations, and leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to boost discoverability.

Objective:

Optimize your existing content for AI search engines, ensuring that it appears in AI-generated answers, is cited as a source, and is discoverable across various platforms.

Instructions:

Step 1: Apply Co-occurrence Optimization
Identify Target Topics: Select a piece of content from your website and identify the primary and secondary topics it should co-occur with. These should align with user queries relevant to your industry.
Example: If you are optimizing a blog post on “Best Collaboration Tools,” identify related topics like "remote team management" and "project management software."
Spread Content Across Platforms: Ensure your content or brand is mentioned across multiple platforms, including blogs, forums, and social media.
Task: Write or update one guest post, answer one question on a forum (e.g., Reddit or Quora), or collaborate with an influencer in your industry to mention your brand in a relevant context.
Monitor and Track: Use a tool like BuzzSumo or Ahrefs to track co-occurrences and adjust your strategy as necessary.
Step 2: Optimize for Citations
Create Citation-Worthy Content: Select one article on your site and ensure it provides comprehensive, original, and up-to-date information.
Task: Update this content to provide unique insights or detailed answers to popular questions in your niche.
Partner with Reputable Sources: Reach out to reputable blogs or news outlets in your industry and propose content partnerships or guest posts to increase your chances of being cited.
Task: Identify 3 high-authority websites (e.g., Forbes, TripAdvisor) where your content could be cited and reach out for collaboration opportunities.
Track Citations: Use tools like Google Search Console or Ahrefs to monitor where your content is being cited. Track the frequency of citations in AI-generated answers across different platforms.
Step 3: Leverage RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for Discoverability
Create RAG-Friendly Content: Select one article or landing page and optimize it for retrieval by AI models. Make sure it answers specific, actionable questions (e.g., “What is the best project management tool for remote teams?”).
Task: Add structured markup (e.g., FAQ schema) to your content to improve its chances of being retrieved by AI models like ChatGPT or Bing AI.
Expand Your Reach: Ensure your content is discoverable across multiple platforms, including YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.
Task: Publish or repurpose one piece of content on a different platform (e.g., a YouTube video or Instagram post) to expand its reach.
Step 4: Track and Measure Your AI Search Performance
Monitor Share of Voice: Use tools like SEMrush or Brandwatch to track how often your brand or content appears in AI-generated answers relative to competitors.
Task: Conduct a share of voice (SOV) analysis for one of your key pieces of content. Compare your SOV to that of competitors and identify areas where you can improve.
Track Citation Frequency: Use Ahrefs or Moz to monitor how frequently your content is cited by AI models. Set a citation benchmark and track your progress over time.
Outcome:

By completing this exercise, you will have optimized your content for AI-powered search engines, increased the likelihood of your content being featured in AI-generated answers, and improved your brand’s discoverability across various platforms. This will enhance your content's visibility and authority in the AI-driven search landscape.

Schema Markup in the Age of AI: Why Structured Data Is Your LLM Visibility Superpower

In an era where AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews are the new front doors to information, traditional SEO is no longer enough. Today, structured data — and specifically schema markup — is one of the most powerful visibility levers for modern businesses.

Schema is no longer just a way to get a rich snippet. It’s how you teach AI what your content means, when to cite it, and how to present it. It’s how your business becomes part of the conversation — even if a user never visits your site.

Why Schema Is a Visibility Signal — Not Just an SEO Hack
Tools like ChatGPT and Gemini use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to surface accurate answers. Instead of crawling pages based on keywords, they synthesize information from structured, cleanly categorized sources. Schema markup is the bridge.

Without schema, your content may be seen — but not understood.

When implemented correctly, schema helps:

Improve AI comprehension — clarifies what type of content is on the page (article, product, FAQ, etc.)

Enable citations in LLMs — supports inclusion in generative responses across platforms

Guide search visibility — enhances your chances of showing up in Google’s AI Overviews and Gemini-generated answers

Schema is no longer code for Google — it’s a visibility signal for the entire AI ecosystem.

The New Role of Schema in LLM Optimization (LLMO)
Large Language Model Optimization (LLMO) is the emerging field of ensuring content is retrievable and useful to AI systems. Unlike traditional SEO, which focuses on ranking in blue links, LLMO is about being chosen, cited, and synthesized.

Schema plays a foundational role in:

Building context for AI retrieval

Feeding structured answers into tools like Perplexity and ChatGPT

Enhancing Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

It’s no longer enough to write well — you have to format for machines.

Types of Schema That Matter Most in AI Search
Here’s a breakdown of schema types that directly influence your AI visibility strategy:

1. Article Schema
Use this for blog posts, news, tutorials.

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "What Is Schema Markup?",
  "author": "Ecco Consultants",
  "datePublished": "2025-06-02"
}
Helps AI tools like Gemini understand your author, topic, and publish date.

2. FAQPage Schema
Use for question-and-answer formats (this blog includes it).

Frequently cited in Perplexity and Google AI Overviews. Gets directly embedded in answers.

3. VideoObject Schema
For embedded tutorials, explainers, testimonials.

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "VideoObject",
  "name": "How to Add Schema Markup",
  "description": "A walkthrough of adding schema markup using Google tools.",
  "thumbnailUrl": "https://eccoai.ai/assets/schema-thumbnail.jpg",
  "uploadDate": "2025-06-02",
  "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecco-schema"
}
Video schema increases your chances of getting AI-generated answer previews and YouTube citations.

 
4. Product Schema
Crucial for e-commerce or service listings.

Shows pricing, availability, and reviews in AI overviews

5. LocalBusiness Schema
Required for local visibility.

Boosts name/address/phone clarity in ChatGPT and Perplexity

Real-World Wins Using Schema
A Utah bakery added LocalBusiness + Product + FAQ schema. Result: +40% traffic, +25% walk-ins, and featured in a Perplexity answer for “best gluten-free bakeries near me.”

A B2B software company used Article + Video schema across their help docs and tutorials. Result: Gemini citations, reduced support ticket volume.

A medspa implemented Speakable schema on a services overview page. Result: Featured snippet-style audio answers via Google.

Schema drives results that aren’t always visible in traffic logs — but you’ll start seeing them in answers.

How to Add Schema Markup (Fast + Right)
Step 1: Identify Schema Type
Choose based on your page. For most cornerstone content, use a combo:

Article (for the blog)

FAQPage (for the questions at the end)

VideoObject (if there’s a video embedded)

Step 2: Use a Schema Generator
Try Technical SEO Schema Markup Generator to create clean JSON-LD.

Step 3: Add It to Your Site
If you’re on WordPress: use RankMath, Yoast, or manual insert via code block

For other CMS: paste JSON-LD into the page <head> or use plugins/modules

Step 4: Validate It
Use Google’s Rich Results Test to check if your schema is error-free

Step 5: Track and Update
Check Google Search Console

Monitor AI citations using Perplexity Labs or Diffbot

 
FAQ: Schema Markup & AI Visibility
What’s the difference between SEO and LLMO? SEO focuses on rankings in classic search. LLMO is about structured content that AIs understand, reuse, and cite.
How does schema help with AI tools like ChatGPT? Schema markup tells AI: “This is a product.” “This is a review.” It lets models confidently synthesize or surface the right content.
Is FAQ schema still useful? Yes! Especially for AI. Perplexity and Gemini love well-structured Q&A formats.
Can schema markup help me show up in Perplexity or Gemini? Yes — many AI tools prefer structured sources. Schema increases your citation and inclusion rate.
Does video schema really work? Absolutely. Tools like Gemini scan for VideoObject fields to surface relevant explainer clips. If your video has clear metadata, it’s more likely to be featured.
Ready to Get Cited by AI?
Schema isn’t optional anymore. If your business depends on organic visibility, structured data is your most powerful edge in 2025.

How to structure your content so it actually gets seen (and cited) by Gemini, Perplexity, and AI Overviews

TL;DR
AI tools aren’t looking for pretty designs or overloaded keywords. They’re looking for clear, structured content that answers real questions. If your site isn’t easy for tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to understand and reuse, you’re probably invisible—even if your SEO looks good on paper.

What’s Really Going On
More than 47% of Google’s results are now influenced by AI-generated summaries. These aren’t traditional blue links. They’re answers—compiled, condensed, and often unattributed. Tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity don’t just rank content. They decide what to use.

So let’s talk about what they actually look for when they scan your site.

1. Your Content Needs to Be Clear and Easy to Use
AI tools are looking for content they can quote. That means:

Short paragraphs

Clear headings

Well-labeled FAQs

Summaries and step-by-step sections

According to WordLift’s breakdown of Google AI Mode, content that’s extractable—like answers in clean FAQ format—is way more likely to appear in AI Overviews.

2. Keywords Aren’t the Whole Game Anymore
Language models don’t just match phrases. They process meaning. This is why semantic clarity matters more than keyword density.

Example: If your blog says, “We help businesses format their content so it’s easily picked up by AI tools,” ChatGPT might still understand that you’re offering GEO or LLMO services—even if you never use those acronyms directly.

3. If You Don’t Mention Your Brand, AI Won’t Either
Want to be cited by name? Make sure your website makes it easy to do that. That means using your brand name in key pages, having a solid About section, and speaking in a way that’s both personal and professional.

Gemini recently cited our schema blog in its AI Overviews. Why? Because the content was structured, the brand was visible, and the writing matched how Gemini selects its sources.

4. Schema Still Matters
Think of schema like a translation layer between your site and AI engines. If you’re using FAQPage, Article, or Organization schema, you’re giving Gemini and ChatGPT a cleaner way to understand what your content actually is.

Need a list of what to use?
We’ve got you. Start with our AI Visibility FAQ for structure tips and schema examples.

5. Not All AI Tools Look for the Same Thing
Each tool has its own behavior.

ChatGPT likes clarity and conversational tone

Gemini is looking for structured, helpful content

Perplexity is citation-heavy and pulls from Medium, PDFs, and forum threads

Want to know where you’re showing up?
That’s what we built Be AI Visible for.

Myths That Keep Getting in the Way
“Backlinks still rule.”
Not when AI is choosing answers based on clarity and context.

“Keyword stuffing still works.”
If your writing sounds robotic, you’ll get skipped.

“Good design = better rankings.”
Looks matter to people. But AI is scanning code, not gradients.

Real Wins From Real Clients
We worked with a local HVAC company that wasn’t showing up anywhere. We optimized their schema, rewrote their FAQ page, and within three months, they were getting cited in Perplexity and seeing a 50% jump in quote requests.

Another e-commerce brand had great content but poor structure. A few internal links and reworked headers later, they were being pulled into Gemini summaries and doubled their click-throughs.

Want to Know If You’re Being Found?
At Ecco Consultants, we help businesses show up where it matters. That means building visibility into your content—not just rankings.

Be AI Visible is one of the tools we use to track whether you’re getting cited in AI engines like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity. If you’re not showing up, we’ll show you why—and help you fix it.

This isn’t about chasing algorithms. This is about being the answer. If your content is clear, helpful, and structured for reuse, AI tools will find it. And if they don’t? We will.

 

👇 Quick FAQ: How to Make Your Site AI-Friendly
What makes a website show up in ChatGPT or Gemini?
Content that’s clear, well-structured, and answers real questions. Tools like ChatGPT look for pages they can reuse in answers — especially ones with schema and a conversational tone.

Do I need schema markup to be found in AI search?
You don’t need it, but it helps. Schema gives AI tools better context about your content. Pages with FAQPage, Article, or Organization schema tend to perform better in AI summaries.

Is this different from regular SEO?
Yes. SEO helps you rank. AI visibility helps you get used in answers. They work together, but the formatting, structure, and strategy are different.

How can I tell if my site is showing up in ChatGPT or Perplexity?
We’re building a tool called Be AI Visible to track that for you. You can join the waitlist here to get early access and visibility insights across major AI tools.


### Gary Vee on AI Search: What This Shift Means for Your Business
The Moment That Changed Everything
Fifteen months ago, Gary Vee asked a room full of business owners:

“Who uses ChatGPT instead of Google to look things up?”

Only 10% stood.

Last week, he asked again.

Everyone stood.

His verdict?

“Even if Gemini wins, Google still loses.”

It wasn’t a soundbite. It was a seismic signal. One that brands can’t afford to ignore.

Why This Shift Is Bigger Than You Think
We’re not talking about a tweak to search behavior. We’re talking about the collapse of the link-based web as the primary interface for discovery.

Instead of ten blue links, users now ask questions and get direct answers—from tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and AI-powered assistants built into phones, browsers, and search overlays.

Zero-click results account for over 65% of searches in 2025 (SparkToro).

That means if your brand isn’t showing up inside AI answers, you’re invisible.

The Rise of AI Visibility (Not Just SEO)
This shift gave birth to a new discipline: AI Visibility.

At Ecco Consultants, we launched the AI Visibility Project to find out what actually works. We’re just a few weeks into testing real strategies, tracking citations, experimenting with schema types, and sharing the process in public.

And what we’ve learned is this:

SEO alone won’t save you. You need structured content, clear answers, and an architecture AI can read.

This is where LLMO (Large Language Model Optimization) and AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) come in. These aren’t buzzwords—they’re survival skills.

Early Signals: What We’re Seeing So Far
While we’re early in our visibility experiments, we’ve already seen signs that structured content is working. We’ve submitted schema manually, tracked how Gemini indexes our posts, and tested how FAQs are used in generative summaries.

The early wins? Our blog content is starting to show up in AI snapshots.

We’re watching how YouTube transcripts and video schema affect citations. We’re testing how FAQs help with tools like Perplexity. And we’re tracking how citations evolve with small changes.

This is an experiment in public — and everything we learn, we share.

Why Gary Vee’s Pattern Recognition Is Dead-On
Gary Vee isn’t just making a dramatic prediction. He’s reading patterns—and he’s seen this movie before.

In the late ‘90s, he pivoted his dad’s liquor store online. In 2006, he jumped on YouTube before most marketers knew what it was. In 2009, he bet big on Facebook ads.

Now?

“We’re in the biggest shift in search since Google was born.”

He’s not wrong. We’re watching it play out.

The Framework: How to Show Up in AI Search
Here’s what we’re building inside the AI Visibility Project:

Structured Content Strategy
Answer-based content. Short, clear responses. Think FAQ-style or Q&A blocks.

Schema Markup
Article, FAQ, Video, and Organization schema give AI clear signals. Use this guide to implement them.

Indexing Infrastructure
Don’t just publish—ping, submit to IndexNow, and test with Google’s Rich Results tool. Gemini watches this.

Citation Tracking
Use tools like Perplexity.ai or DataForSEO to check if your brand is getting cited.

AI Search FAQs
Answer high-intent questions users ask in ChatGPT. We use our own visibility tracker to log and respond to these in real time.

Why This Isn’t SEO Anymore
We still believe in SEO basics. But this isn’t about stuffing keywords or chasing backlinks. It’s about Relevance Engineering.

That means:

Structuring content for machines and humans.

Designing for speed, clarity, and search satisfaction.

Thinking about how AI interprets, not just how users search.

Google search isn’t dead. But the interface has changed. And most businesses are still optimizing for a world that’s fading fast.

Final Word: If You’re Not Cited, You’re Not Seen
Gary Vee was right. The shift is happening.

Most brands are still stuck in the link economy while the answer economy is taking over.

Frequently Asked Questions (AI Search + Visibility)
How does ChatGPT decide what to cite?
ChatGPT pulls from sources it considers structured, trustworthy, and accurate. Schema and clarity help.

Does schema markup guarantee visibility in AI search?
No, but it improves your chances by helping AI interpret and organize your content.

Can I show up in both ChatGPT and Gemini?
Yes, but the requirements differ slightly. Gemini favors fresh content and indexed schema. ChatGPT relies more on structured answers and citations.

What’s the best way to get started?
Start by answering specific questions clearly and adding schema to your most helpful blog posts.

Is this replacing traditional SEO?
Not yet. Think of it as an evolution—SEO for AI.

How to structure your content so it actually gets seen (and cited) by Gemini, Perplexity, and AI Overviews

TL;DR
AI tools aren’t looking for pretty designs or overloaded keywords. They’re looking for clear, structured content that answers real questions. If your site isn’t easy for tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to understand and reuse, you’re probably invisible—even if your SEO looks good on paper.

What’s Really Going On
More than 47% of Google’s results are now influenced by AI-generated summaries. These aren’t traditional blue links. They’re answers—compiled, condensed, and often unattributed. Tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity don’t just rank content. They decide what to use.

So let’s talk about what they actually look for when they scan your site.

1. Your Content Needs to Be Clear and Easy to Use
AI tools are looking for content they can quote. That means:

Short paragraphs

Clear headings

Well-labeled FAQs

Summaries and step-by-step sections

According to WordLift’s breakdown of Google AI Mode, content that’s extractable—like answers in clean FAQ format—is way more likely to appear in AI Overviews.

2. Keywords Aren’t the Whole Game Anymore
Language models don’t just match phrases. They process meaning. This is why semantic clarity matters more than keyword density.

Example: If your blog says, “We help businesses format their content so it’s easily picked up by AI tools,” ChatGPT might still understand that you’re offering GEO or LLMO services—even if you never use those acronyms directly.

3. If You Don’t Mention Your Brand, AI Won’t Either
Want to be cited by name? Make sure your website makes it easy to do that. That means using your brand name in key pages, having a solid About section, and speaking in a way that’s both personal and professional.

Gemini recently cited our schema blog in its AI Overviews. Why? Because the content was structured, the brand was visible, and the writing matched how Gemini selects its sources.

4. Schema Still Matters
Think of schema like a translation layer between your site and AI engines. If you’re using FAQPage, Article, or Organization schema, you’re giving Gemini and ChatGPT a cleaner way to understand what your content actually is.
