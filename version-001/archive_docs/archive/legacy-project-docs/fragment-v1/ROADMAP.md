### Business Risks

- **Market Timing**: AI search adoption accelerating, first-mover advantage
  critical
- **Competitive Response**: Large players entering GEO space, differentiate on
  experience
- **Customer Acquisition**: High-touch sales initially, optimize for
  self-service later

### Execution Risks

- **Team Burnout**: Sustainable sprint pace, clear success metrics
- **Scope Creep**: Revenue-first feature prioritization, customer validation
  required
- **Technical Debt**: Refactor when blocking growth, not before
