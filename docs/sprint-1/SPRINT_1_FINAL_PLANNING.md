## 🚧 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items

1. **API Rate Limits** (Probability: High, Impact: High)
   - _Risk_: Multiple AI model queries may hit rate limits during demo
   - _Mitigation_: Implement intelligent caching and request batching
   - _Fallback_: Use cached demo data for critical demo scenarios

2. **Response Time** (Probability: Medium, Impact: High)
   - _Risk_: Multi-model queries may be slow, affecting demo flow
   - _Mitigation_: Parallel execution and timeout handling
   - _Fallback_: Progressive loading with partial results

3. **Data Quality** (Probability: Medium, Impact: Medium)
   - _Risk_: Web scraping may return inconsistent results
   - _Mitigation_: Multiple data sources and validation
   - _Fallback_: Mock data for demo scenarios

### Medium Risk Items

1. **Integration Complexity** (Probability: Medium, Impact: Medium)
   - _Risk_: Existing chat system integration challenges
   - _Mitigation_: Incremental integration and testing
   - _Fallback_: Isolated demo environment

2. **Demo Stability** (Probability: Low, Impact: High)
   - _Risk_: Live data may be unpredictable for demo
   - _Mitigation_: Fallback demo data and scenarios
   - _Fallback_: Pre-recorded demo segments

### Low Risk Items

1. **Mobile Responsiveness** (Probability: Low, Impact: Low)
   - _Risk_: Artifacts may not render well on mobile
   - _Mitigation_: Mobile-first design approach
   - _Fallback_: Desktop-only demo if needed
