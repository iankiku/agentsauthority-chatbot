# GEO/SEO Chat AI Powered Dashboard - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Transform the existing Vercel AI chatbot into a specialized GEO (Generative
Engine Optimization) and SEO dashboard where users interact with their brand
visibility data through natural language queries. The dashboard creates
persistent, actionable insights that live beyond chat sessions.

## Problem Statement: 
comment: This should answere Why are we building this? see the vision docs

### Current State:
comment: what is the current state of seo/geo and marketing tools for seo teams?
how are we going to change that?

- Static dashboard pages with pre-defined charts and metrics
- Users must navigate through multiple pages to find insights
- Limited interactivity and customization options
- Chat responses are ephemeral - no persistent value creation
- No unified view of brand performance across AI platforms

### Pain Points:
comments: maybe some of these are true

1. **Information Silos**: Data scattered across separate pages
2. **Limited Exploration**: Users can't ask ad-hoc questions
3. **Ephemeral Insights**: Chat responses disappear after session
4. **Complex Navigation**: Multiple clicks to access related information
5. **No AI Platform Focus**: Generic chat without GEO/SEO specialization

## Vision & Objectives

### Vision:
vision must tie with our pitch and the painpoints we want to identify

Create a conversational dashboard experience where users interact with their
GEO/SEO data through natural language, generating persistent insights that
become part of their ongoing analytics dashboard.

### Primary Objectives

1. **Unify UX**: Consistent chat-canvas pattern across all dashboard pages
2. **Enable Natural Interaction**: Plain English queries for any visualization
3. **Create Persistent Value**: Chat queries generate lasting dashboard

5. **Provide Infinite Flexibility**: Generate any combination of data views
   on-demand

### Success Metrics
